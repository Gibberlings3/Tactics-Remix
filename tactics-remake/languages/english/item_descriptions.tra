@4000 = ~Short Sword~
@4001 = ~The short sword is the first type of sword to come into existence. In the simplest of terms, a short sword can be considered a dagger with a blade so long that it can no longer be called a dagger. The term short sword does not exist in sword classifications. However, it has come to be used to describe a double-edged blade about two feet in length. The sword tip is usually pointed, ideal for thrusting.

A greedy essence seems to inhabit this weapon, pore-like holes in the blade soaking up any blood it touches.

The Lucky Ones mercenary company commissioned these blades while still flush from their last big score. After their windfall they only adventured for the thrill of it, challenging each other to ever-greater feats of daring-do. Why are these weapons no longer with them? Sometimes the "big nasty" wins.

@4100 = ~Katana~
@4101 = ~The katana is a single-edged, slightly curved sword that ends with a chisel point. The katana is perhaps one of the finest swords ever made, the steps to its creation a long and secret process that is more art form than anything else. This blade is an important facet of Kara-Turan culture. To touch or wield a samurai's katana is to insult the samurai and to incite his wrath. For a gaijin, or foreigner, to own such a blade is a rare occurrence. Either the gaijin is a greatly honored friend of an important minister, or the gaijin has murdered a samurai.

Crafted by a talented young smith, they were to be the masterwork that earned him a right to study under the greatest blacksmith in the city. Instead, he became smitten with a cleric of Helm - and subsequently mocked by his peers, for the cleric was half-orc and ugly to their eyes. Unlike them, the young smith saw the cleric's beauty reflected in her kindness and unwavering devotion, and dedicated himself to the church soon after giving these boots to her. Alas, the smith did not live long in his duities as a Helmite - perishing in the defense of a merchant caravan who had appealed to the church for protection from bandits - but his boots were enchanted to honor his memory and dedication, and the cleric he gifted them to wore them until the day she died.
