## Introduction

Tactics Remix adds quite a few optional, but difficult, encounters to BG2:EE and EET aimed to make the game more challenging and rewarding.

Many of these components have been drawn from different mod authors; I did not write everything here. In particular, Wes Weimer, Gebhard Blucher, Kensai Ryu, Xyx and Ishan have made contributions. I have gone through, updated the components for the EE's, and redid most of the AI from the ground up. The goal is for the encounters to feel similar to their oBG counterparts with more challenging enemy AI.

The original Tactics can be found [here](https://weidu.org/tactics.html).

## Compatibility
If you are upgrading from an earlier version of this mod, I recommend uninstalling all mod components and replacing all files with the new ones before doing a fresh install. If you choose to use SCS, parts of this mod should be installed before it while other parts should be installed after. These will be clearly outlined during the install process.

## Content

Tactics Remix adds quite a few new components, and all of the components are individually optional: you may install some but not others, your choice. I have also broken up the mods into two groups: 1) Add New Encounters and 2) Update Existing Encounters. New encounters should be installed prior to SCS while updates to existing encounters should be installed after SCS (if you, the player, chooses to use SCS).

### Add New Encounters - Install BEFORE SCS

#### "Kuroisan", the Acid Kensai

Kuroisan, a Kensai / Wu Jen from Kara-Tur will eventually approach you if you are carrying (and wielding) Celestial Fury or Malakar. He is obsessed with Katanas and will try to take yours. 

#### The Ritual

The Ritual component adds a new tactical quest. You can start the quest by speaking to a yellow-robed fellow outside the Watcher's Keep and involves some outdoor combat and obscure symbolism against a very pretty backdrop. Original recommendation for party level is wait until everyone has around 2,000,000 XP. 

#### "Red Badge" Poison-Based Encounter

This challenge is triggered if you are standing outside the Watcher's Keep. You must have more than 3 million XP, and you must either have killed Gromnir or be in SoA. 

#### Gebhard Blucher's Lich in the Docks

A new lich can be found in the Docks district: enter the door to the north of the main Shadow Thief guildhouse entrance. 

#### Kensai Ryu's Gnome Fighter/Illusionist in the Docks

A gnome fighter/illusionist is looking for Valygar inside a building in the docks and he will kill anyone in his way. 

### Update Existing Encounters - Install AFTER SCS

#### Gebhard Blucher's Improved Demon Knights

This makes the Demon Knights (notably, those at the Demogorgon altar in the Underdark) better opponents. They have more powerful spells and are more resistant to cheese. 

#### Kensai Ryu's Improved Crypt King

Large overhaul for the original Crypt King fight within the Graveyard district. I have overhauled the fight mechanics to make it even more challenging than the original Tactics version. 

#### More encounters will be added.
