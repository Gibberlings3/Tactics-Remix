In the simplest of terms, a short sword can be considered a dagger with a blade so long that it can no longer be called a dagger. The term short sword does not exist in sword classifications. However, it has come to be used to describe a double-edged blade about two feet in length. The sword tip is usually pointed, ideal for thrusting.

This accursed amulet smells strongly of blood and dust. It came into your possession during your involvement with the Ritual affair.

It appears to grant the bearer all of the magical immunities and defenses normally associated with a young vampire: regeneration; resistance to cold and electricity; immunity to poison, fear, sleep, level drain, hold, charm and non-magical weapons. Truly noble hearts cannot bear to don the amulet and it cannot be removed without clerical aid. You feel certain that the powers of the amulet must come with a terrible price, but you cannot detect any such downside. In fact, the amulet feels strangely natural and stirs something deep in your memory.

This technique worked well, allowing the user a far greater resistance to spells than normal... but other magewrights looked upon this creation with a growing fear, worried that a creature that fed on magic might soon grow too hungry and feed upon its masters instead. Because of this, only a few suits of this armor were ever made, and the creatures created by the Imaskari sealed away and forgotten. When Imaskar fell, it is likely they crept back into the silent darkness they'd come from... or possibly changed into something else...
